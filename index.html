           Hi there, I'm emily00xp! I'm glad you found my page! Please feel free to check out the links above.

           I hope you're able to find something useful, specially if you're a n00bie such as myself.
           And remember, this path is not meant to be an easy one. If you feel like you're not gonna be able to do it, take a deep breath, take a break,
           then try again, because giving up shall not be an option.

           Learning in general will always be a journey, just make sure you're able to enjoy the experiences on the way! But hey, this is not
           supposed to be an emotional speech or whatever like that...

           Some days are harder than others, and that is totally okay... just keep going, you'll get there. 
           Try harder!
